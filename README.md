# Overview
This project is a remake of [Bop It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bop_It).

# How To Play The Game
1. Wait for an LED to light up.
2. Depending on which LED lit up, you must "bop" (press) the corresponding button, or "twist" the corresponding potentiometer, or "pull" (move) the joystick in any direction.
3. Depending on the difficulty chosen, you must do so within either 5 seconds (easy mode), 3 seconds (normal mode), or 1 second (hard mode). If you fail to "bop", "twist", or "pull" within the time limit, the system will be reset and the difficulty will be changed back to easy mode.
4. You may change the difficulty (easy, normal, or hard) at any time by pressing the difficulty button.
